			<p class="text-body">Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch - these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots.<br><br>

			A notable example of a hackathon &quot;hack&quot;, GroupMe is a group messaging app that was acquired by Skype for over $50 million. Other notable examples include the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button and Facebook Chat which were both first demoed at internal company hackathons.<br><br>

			Whether we are building a website, mobile app, or even hardware hack, the goal is to start from scratch and end with a working prototype. Generally, these events last from 24-48 hours and are filled with food, caffeine, prizes, and, you guessed it, more caffeine. After time runs out, teams demo what they've built and compete for prizes.<br><br>

			To sum it up, at a hackathon, people come together and use technology to transform ideas into reality.</p>
